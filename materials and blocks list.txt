base-building game - can be done in 1 hour.  This is a top-down 2D game like Zelda, played on 1 big map.  
To start, the player has only themselves and the crafting table, the Fab-o-Mat.   

BASE BLOCKS--------------
There are 10 base blocks 
	AUTOMATIC
		Fab-o-Mat < always
	COMMON MATS
		Storage < Silicate
		Corridor < Silicate
		Fence < Metal
		Mine < Metal
	SCARCE MATS
		Perimeter Sensor < Rare Metal
		Hydroponics < Organics
		Landing Pad < Fuel, Rare Metal
	RARE MATS
		Reactor, Meteor Defense Turret < Radioactives
	LANDING PAD REQUIRED
		Cockpit < Organics, Rare Metal, Metal
		Engine < Fuel
		Reactor < Radioactives
		Cargo Hold < MetalO

The top of the map is a 2D horizon, and that is where the landing pad must be built, so the other blocks start there.   
Radiating out from this point materials are common, scarce and then rare.

HAZARDS----------
To hinder the player in their discovery of these materials, there are hazards as follows:
	Skrigs < Perimeter Sensor, which are a small scavenger that nibbles on the base (common).  Your defense against them is the Perimeter Sensor
	Shaggy Nightbeest (scarce) < Fence, a savage predator.  Your defense is Fence.
	Meteorites < Turret, which will damage or destroy base blocks if they hit, but can be shot down once you build the Turret.
